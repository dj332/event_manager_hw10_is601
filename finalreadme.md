## Issues
### Issue 1
**Issue Despcription:** Something here

**Fix:** The given nickname at register endpoint is not stored in the database. Changed the functionality to store it in the database. If it already exists, it will generate a random nickname. This can be changed in the future, but currently it is a good solution.
